/vote detailed?

Show the the site voting instructions and your current cooldowns for voting.

The cooldowns are purely informational - if the site lets you vote, you'll get the reward.

You can vote every 12 hours on all three links to get three rewards!

Vote rewards

Cash: 100,000 * player level
 10 * player level
 5 * player level
 2 * player level
E.g. for a player that is level 5, they get 500,000 %{cashmoji}, 50  and so on.

Vote Streak
Every 7 days of voting (21 votes) your reward multiplier is tripled (for one vote).

Every 21 votes increases the base reward multiplier by 1.

So on vote 42, you'd get x6 reward. On vote 43, you'd get x2 vote reward.

Weekend Voting
Voting for the bot on 'the weekend' on top.gg counts as 2 votes so your reward then will be doubled. This combines with the vote streak.

top.gg calculates what 'the weekend' as Friday - Sunday in their timezone
