The game starts with a x1 multiplier which goes up every few seconds.

Every time it tries to jump up, there's a 10% chance it will CRASH üí• and you'll lose your bet!

Hit üõë before that happens and you win bet x multiplier!

Hard Mode

The game is the same but it doesn't tell you the multiplier or if it's crashed, you just react at some point within the 2 minute game timer and find out if you won and how much!

The multiplier goes up twice as fast and the chance of crashing stays at 10%

Play a game of Texas Hold'em Bonus versus the dealer!

Ante bet:
Your ante bet is buy-in to see your 2 cards.
You can fold if your hand is terrible and lose your bet.

To play, you must then bet an additional 2 x your ante bet
This will show the 3 river cards.

You can then bet or check two more times as two additional cards are shown.

If your best 5 card hand beats the dealers, you get a payout based on the table

Example:

Bet 100 ante to start
Bet 2x ante (200) to play
Bet 1x ante (100)
Bet 1x ante (100)
Win/lose (500 total)
Bonus bet
The bonus bet is based purely on the dealer and player hands, ignoring the river cards.

If you fold, check, or lose on the ante bets, you can still win the bonus bet which pays out based on the pay table.

All In
All in bets will skip straight to the end of the game (with no chance to fold, bet or check) with a doubled payout. E.g. a royal flush on all in would pay out 10:1

You cannot go all in and bet on bonus at the same time.
